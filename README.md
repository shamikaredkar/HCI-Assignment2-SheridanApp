# HCI-Assignment2-SheridanApp
This is a Figma assignment for the Sheridan Course App, which is an application designed to help students at Sheridan College manage their courses, assignments, and schedules. The purpose of this assignment is to design the user interface and user experience for the app using Figma, a collaborative design tool.
When designing a mobile application for courses at Sheridan College for college students between the age groups of 18 to 30, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of different audience groups. Here are some things to consider for each group of audience:
1.	Sheridan College Students:
a.	The app should be easy to use and navigate, with a simple and intuitive user interface.
b.	Students may want to access course materials, submit assignments, and view grades from the app, so these features should be prioritized.
c.	The app should be accessible on both iOS and Android platforms and should be optimized for both smartphones and tablets.
d.	Personalization features like the ability to customize their dashboard or choose a preferred color scheme could make the app more engaging for students.
2.	Faculty Members:
a.	Faculty members may want to use the app to post course content, assignments, and grades, so these features should be easy to access and use.
b.	The app should also allow faculty members to communicate with students and receive notifications about student submissions and progress.
c.	Access to administrative tools like the ability to create and modify course content and assessments should be restricted to faculty members.
3.	Administrative Staff:
a.	The app should allow administrative staff members to communicate with students, provide support, and access course-related information.
b.	The app should also allow staff members to view student profiles and academic records, and to send push notifications to students when necessary.
c.	The app should be designed to ensure that student data is kept secure and confidential.
4.	Parents/Guardians:
a.	The app should provide a clear and concise view of their child's progress, grades, and assignments.
b.	The app should also provide a way for parents/guardians to communicate with faculty members or academic advisors when necessary.
c.	The app should ensure that student data is kept secure and confidential, and that parents/guardians have access only to their child's information.
